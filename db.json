        "summary": "I'm a software developer specializing in full-stack development, particularly focusing on crafting exceptional web interfaces. Prioritizing user experience (UX), I utilize the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) alongside TypeScript to transform your concepts into reality. However, my expertise extends beyond these technologies. I am adept in various front-end libraries like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material UI, enabling me to tailor the visual presentation according to your precise requirements."
